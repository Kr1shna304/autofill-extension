# Job Application Autofill Extension

This is a simple Chrome/Brave extension designed to **autofill specific job application fields** on the final submission page of certain job portals (e.g., People First). It helps streamline the application process by automatically selecting predefined values for a fixed set of dropdown fields.

## üîß What It Does

- Fills 9 predefined fields automatically with your preferred values (e.g., Vacancy Source, Relatives, Disability status, etc.).
- Only works on specific job pages where these fields appear.
- Triggered **manually** when the user clicks the extension icon (not on page load).
- Can be customized easily to match different field labels and values.

---

## üìù Customization

The autofill behavior is controlled in `content.js`. You can:

- **Edit** the dropdown options you want to fill.
- **Change the titles or field IDs** based on updates in the target web page.
- **Add or remove fields** by modifying the `fieldMap` array in `content.js`.

### Example snippet from `content.js`:
```javascript
const fieldMap = [
    { id: "18:_input", title: "People First" },  // Vacancy Source
    { id: "22:_input", title: "No" },            // Relatives
    { id: "26:_input", title: "I do not have disability" }, // Disability
    { id: "30:_input", title: "Not Applicable" },           // Right To First Interview
    { id: "34:_input", title: "No" },            // Currently employed with Agency
    { id: "38:_input", title: "No" },            // Received Promotional Appointment
    { id: "42:_input", title: "No" },            // Convicted felimony
    { id: "46:_input", title: "No" },            // Guilty in crime
    { id: "50:_input", title: "No" }             // Guilt withheld in crime
];
````

Just update the `"id"` and `"title"` values as per your need.

* The extension is only meant for personal use on job portals with a known and stable structure.

```
